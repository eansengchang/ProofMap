        "proof": "(a) implies (b). Indeed, all fundamental groups in a component are isomorphic to one another, so triviality of one of them implies triviality of all. The reverse implication is obvious.\\n\\n(a) implies (c). Due to path-connectedness, all morphism sets in $\\\\Pi_1(X)$ are isomorphic and thus consist of a single element. For the converse, note that all morphism sets in $\\\\Pi_1(X)$ being non-empty implies that $X$ is path-connected. Morphism sets consisting of a single element gives in particular that the fundamental group at each basepoint is trivial.\\n\\n(c) implies (d). Indeed, assumption (c) says that all morphism sets in $\\\\Pi_1(X)$ consist of a single element. The unique morphism $[\\\\gamma] \\\\in \\\\pi_1(X, x, y)$ is then identified with the morphism $(x, y)$ in $X \\\\times Y$. This is readily seen to be a bijection $\\\\Pi_1(X) \\\\to X \\\\times X$ which, by uniqueness of morphism sets, automatically preserves composition and inverses and is thus a functor.\\n\\n(b) implies (e). Take a class $[\\\\gamma] \\\\in [S^1, X]$ and note that $\\\\gamma$ also represents a class in $\\\\pi_1(X, \\\\gamma(1))$. Item (b) implies that this class is trivial, meaning that $\\\\gamma$ is nullhomotopic using a homotopy relative endpoints. In particular, it is nullhomotopic without fixing endpoints.\\n\\n(e) implies (a). Recall that there is an injective map $\\\\pi_0(X) \\\\to [S^1, X]$ sending $[x]$ to the class of the constant map $[c_x]$. Item (e) then implies $\\\\pi_0(X) \\\\cong \\\\{.\\\\}$, meaning that $X$ is path-connected. Consider now a class $[\\\\gamma] \\\\in \\\\pi_1(X, x)$ and regard it as a class in $[S^1, X]$. I.e. we take the loop $\\\\gamma : S^1 \\\\to X$, which is based at $x \\\\in X$, and now we allow homotopies $F : S^1 \\\\times [0, 1] \\\\to X$ which are not relative endpoints (i.e. $F(0, s)$ may not be $x$). Consider the path $\\\\alpha : [0, 1] \\\\to X$ given by $\\\\alpha(t) = F(1, t)$.\\n\\nThe assumption $[S^1, X] \\\\cong \\\\{.\\\\}$ says that there is a homotopy $F$ between $\\\\gamma$ and a constant loop $c_z$. Using the change of basepoint formula (Theorem 6.3) we then deduce\\n\\n$[\\\\gamma] = [\\\\alpha] \\\\bullet [c_z] \\\\bullet [\\\\alpha] = [\\\\alpha] \\\\bullet [\\\\alpha] = [c_x]$.\\n\\nSince this is true for all homotopy classes in $\\\\pi_1(X, x)$, simply-connectedness follows.",

        "proof": "First step: choosing a cover. We first cover $X$ by two opens $A$ and $B$, whose intersection $I = A \\\\cap B$ is path-connected. For this, we let $\\\\gamma \\\\subset S^2$ be the meridian $\\\\{x = 0, y \\\\geq 0\\\\}$. Let $U \\\\subset S^2$ be an open containing $\\\\gamma$, to be defined precisely in a moment. We then let $A = U \\\\cup [0, 1]$ and $B = S^2 \\\\setminus \\\\gamma$.\\n\\nSecond step: verifying openness. We see that $A$ is open because we can explicitly find neighbourhoods in $A$ of any of its points. For points in $(0, 1)$ it suffices to take a small interval. For points in $U \\\\setminus \\\\{N, S\\\\}$ we take $U \\\\setminus \\\\{N, S\\\\}$, which is an open in $S^2$. For $N$ and $S$ we take the union of a small interval in $[0, 1]$ (at $0$ or $1$) and $U$. That $B$ is open follows from the fact that $\\\\gamma$ was closed, so $B$ is an open in $S^2$ that is disjoint from the poles.\\n\\nThird step: verifying that the intersection is path-connected. Up to here the argument worked for any $U$, but now we need to be a bit more precise. We require that $U$ is homeomorphic to an open 2-disc. To do this, consider the point $R = (0, -1, 0) \\\\in S^2$ and the stereographic projection $\\\\phi : S^2 \\\\setminus \\\\{R\\\\} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^2$. Recall that $\\\\phi$ is a homeomorphism. Since $\\\\gamma$ is contained in the complement of $R$, $\\\\phi(\\\\gamma)$ is a curve in $\\\\mathbb{R}^2$. Since it is compact, it is contained in any sufficiently big open disc $U' \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^2$. We then let $U = \\\\phi^{-1}(U')$.\\n\\nConsider now $I = U \\\\setminus \\\\gamma$. This is homeomorphic to $U' \\\\setminus \\\\phi(\\\\gamma)$, via $\\\\phi$. This is a big open disc minus a curve. In fact, we can be precise and recall what the stereographic projection does. If you do this you will see that $\\\\phi(\\\\gamma)$ is a closed interval within the X-axis. It then follows that $U' \\\\setminus \\\\phi(\\\\gamma)$ deformation retracts, pushing radially, to some sufficiently big circle $S \\\\subset U'$. In particular, $U \\\\setminus \\\\gamma$ is homotopy equivalent to $S \\\\simeq S^1$, so it is path-connected.\\n\\nThird step: computing the fundamental group of the pieces. The previous computation shows that $\\\\pi_1(I, i) \\\\simeq \\\\mathbb{Z}$ for any $i$. We now look at $A$ and $B$.\\n\\nWe can see that $B$ is contractible. Indeed, performing stereographic projection, now from $(0, 1, 0)$, we can identify $B$ with a subset of $\\\\mathbb{R}^2$ that is star-shaped. It follows that $\\\\pi_1(B, b) \\\\simeq 0$ for any $b$.\\n\\nLastly, we can show that $A$ deformation retracts to $\\\\gamma \\\\cup [0, 1]$. This deformation retraction we define to be fixed over $[0, 1]$. By the pasting lemma, it suffices that we explain how $U$ deformation retracts to $\\\\gamma$. This is equivalent to proving that $U'$ deformation retracts to $\\\\phi(\\\\gamma)$. This you can do by first contracting $U'$ linearly to the X-axis and then contracting the X-axis to the interval $\\\\phi(\\\\gamma)$. It follows that $\\\\pi_1(A, a) \\\\simeq \\\\mathbb{Z}$ for any $a$.\\n\\nDo note that all the pieces are path-connected, which is why we did not have to be careful with basepoints. It follows that $X$ is also path-connected, so we can also compute its $\\\\pi_1$ at any point.\\n\\nFourth step: explicit generators. We now need to identify the curves whose homotopy classes generate the fundamental groups we have computed. This is required in order to compute pushforwards.\\n\\nWe need to fix a basepoint $i \\\\in I$. We choose $i \\\\in \\\\phi^{-1}(S)$, where $S \\\\subset U'$ is the big circle we chose earlier. We saw that $I$ deformation retracts to $\\\\phi^{-1}(S)$. It is a circle that can be parametrised to yield a generator $\\\\beta$ of $\\\\pi_1(I, i) \\\\simeq \\\\langle\\\\beta | \\\\rangle$.\\n\\nWe deformation retracted $A$ to $\\\\gamma\\\\cup[0, 1]$. It follows that this curve (once we choose a parametrisation) precisely represents the generator $\\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\pi_1(A, N) \\\\simeq \\\\langle\\\\alpha | \\\\rangle$, with $N$ the north pole. We then use change of basepoint to establish an isomorphism $\\\\pi_1(A, N) \\\\simeq \\\\pi_1(A, i)$. We still denote the generator in $\\\\pi_1(A, i)$ by $\\\\alpha$.\\n\\nFifth step: the pushforwards. Let us write $\\\\iota_A : I \\\\to A$ and $\\\\iota_B : I \\\\to B$ for the inclusions. Observe that\\n\\n$(\\\\iota_B)_* : \\\\pi_1(I, i) \\\\to \\\\pi_1(B, i)$\\n\\nis identically zero, since the target group is zero. We claim that\\n\\n$(\\\\iota_A)_* : \\\\pi_1(I, i) \\\\to \\\\pi_1(A, i)$\\n\\nis also zero, even though both groups are isomorphic to $\\\\mathbb{Z}$. The reason is that the curve $\\\\phi^{-1}(S)$ is fully contained in $U$, which is contractible, meaning that all loops within are nullhomotopic. In particular:\\n\\n$(\\\\iota_A)_*(\\\\beta) \\\\in \\\\pi_1(U, i) = \\\\{[c_i]\\\\} \\\\subset \\\\pi_1(A, i)$.\\n\\nSixth step: the conclusion. We have checked that $A$ and $B$ are open and that $I$ is path-connected, so we are in the hypothesis of the theorem of van Kampen. We have also deduced that $X$ is path-connected, so we can compute $\\\\pi_1$ at any basepoint. Then:\\n\\n$\\\\pi_1(X, i) \\\\simeq \\\\pi_1(A, i) *_{\\\\pi_1(I,i)} \\\\pi_1(B, i) \\\\simeq \\\\mathbb{Z} *_{\\\\mathbb{Z}} 0 \\\\simeq \\\\langle\\\\alpha | \\\\rangle$,\\n\\nwhere in the last step we have used that $(\\\\iota_A)_*$ and $(\\\\iota_B)_*$ are zero and thus introduce no relations.",

        "proof": "This application is more difficult than the ones we have seen so far, since we cannot apply the group version of van Kampen. Indeed, cover $S^1$ by two open intervals $A$ and $B$ by letting $A$ be a neighbourhood of the upper hemisphere and $B$ a neighbourhood of the lower one. Then $I = A \\\\cap B$ has two components: one of them $I^+$ is an open interval around $1 \\\\in S^1$ and the other $I^-$ is an open interval around $-1$. Since $I$ is not path-connected, Theorem 9.11 does not apply.\\n\\nInstead we consider the subset $P = \\\\{1, -1\\\\} \\\\subset S^1$. Our goal is to apply Theorem 10.11. Observe that $\\\\pi_1(A, P)$ and $\\\\pi_1(B, P)$ are both isomorphic to the pair groupoid of $P$ (Lemma 6.15). I.e. $\\\\pi_1(A, P)$ contains the morphisms $\\\\{c_1, c_{-1}, a, a^{-1}\\\\}$ representing, respectively, the constant paths in $A$ with value $1$ or $-1$, the unique class of path from $1$ to $-1$ within $A$, and its inverse. Similarly, $\\\\pi_1(B, P) = \\\\{c_1, c_{-1}, b, b^{-1}\\\\}$; now $b$ is the unique path from $-1$ to $1$ within $B$. Lastly, $\\\\pi_1(I, P) = \\\\{c_1, c_{-1}\\\\}$, since the two points cannot be connected within $I$.\\n\\nUsing the fact that amalgamated products are pushouts in Grpoid (Lemma 10.6) and Theorem 10.11 we deduce that:\\n\\n$\\\\pi_1(S^1, P) \\\\simeq \\\\{c_1, c_{-1}, a, a^{-1}\\\\} *_{\\\\{c_1,c_{-1}\\\\}} \\\\{c_1, c_{-1}, b, b^{-1}\\\\}$.\\n\\nNow it remains to spell out what this means using the definition of amalgamated product of groupoids (Definition 10.3).\\n\\nThe objects underlying $\\\\pi_1(A, P)$, $\\\\pi_1(B, P)$ and $\\\\pi_1(I, P)$ are all $P$, so the set of objects of $\\\\pi_1(S^1, P)$ is also $P$. Let us now focus on the morphisms that go from $1$ to $1$ (i.e. $\\\\pi_1(S^1, 1)$!) These are words written using the letters $a$ and $b$. Subsequent letters must be concatenable. This means that only $b$ or $a^{-1}$ can follow $a$. Similarly, only $a$ or $b^{-1}$ can follow $b$. Furthermore, since we are assuming that we begin and end at $1$, the words we look at must begin in $a$ or $b^{-1}$ and finish in $b$ or $a^{-1}$.\\n\\nPutting these constraints together it follows that, once we simplify any word by cancelling inverses, it must be an alternation of $a$ and $b$ or an alternation of $a^{-1}$ and $b^{-1}$. Let us list these words concretely:\\n\\n$\\\\pi_1(S^1, 1) \\\\simeq \\\\{\\\\cdot \\\\cdot \\\\cdot, (ba)^{-3}(ba)^{-2}, (ba)^{-1}, 1, ba, (ba)^2, (ba)^3, \\\\cdot \\\\cdot \\\\cdot \\\\}$\\n\\nthe composition being concatenation.

Once that is established we can write $P = Q(z - z_0)$, with $z_0$ the root we found and $Q$ of order exactly $k - 1$, so induction can be applied.

We write out $\\\\omega$ as a word $[\\\\alpha_m] \\\\cdot \\\\cdot \\\\cdot [\\\\alpha_1]$ with each $[\\\\alpha_i]$ a class in either $\\\\Pi_1(A)$ or $\\\\Pi_1(B)$. Similarly, we write out $\\\\omega'$ as $[\\\\beta_n] \\\\cdot \\\\cdot \\\\cdot [\\\\beta_1]$. In order to make the concrete groupoid explicit, we sometimes write a letter as $[-]!$ with $!$ a label that can be either $A$ or $B$. Assuming $\\\\Psi(\\\\omega) = \\\\Psi(\\\\omega')$ means that $\\\\alpha_m \\\\bullet \\\\cdot \\\\cdot \\\\cdot \\\\bullet \\\\alpha_1$ and $\\\\beta_n \\\\bullet \\\\cdot \\\\cdot \\\\cdot \\\\bullet \\\\beta_1$ are homotopic to each other relative endpoints. We write $\\\\Gamma : [0, 1]^2 \\\\to X$ for this homotopy. Up to reparametrisation, we can assume that $\\\\alpha_i(t) = \\\\Gamma(i/m + t/m, 0)$ and $\\\\beta_j(t) = \\\\Gamma(j/n + t/n, 1)$.\\n\\nWe fix a sufficiently large multiple $N$ of $mn$. By Corollary 12.5, $\\\\Gamma$ takes each square\\n\\n$C_{u,v} = I_u \\\\times I_v = [u/N, (u + 1)/N ] \\\\times [v/N, (v + 1)/N ]$\\n\\nto $A$ or $B$ (or possibly the intersection of the two). Up to choices, this determines a labelling that assigns $A$ or $B$ to each $C_{u,v}$. We denote the vertical segments by $V_{u,v} = I_u \\\\times \\\\{v/N \\\\}$ and the horizontal segments by $H_{u,v} = \\\\{u/N \\\\} \\\\times I_v$. These are the sides of the squares $C_{a,b}$. This is pictured in Figure 12.1. We can parametrise $V_{u,v}$ using $\\\\nu^+_{u,v}(t) = (u/N + t/N, v)$ or its reverse $\\\\nu^-_{u,v}$, each corresponding to one of the two possible orientations. Similarly, we can parametrise $H_{u,v}$ using $\\\\chi^+_{u,v}(t) = (u, v/N + t/N )$ or the reverse $\\\\chi^-_{u,v}$.\\n\\nWe can apply move (II) repeatedly to relate $\\\\omega$ to the word $\\\\omega_0 = [\\\\Gamma \\\\circ \\\\nu^+_{N-1,0}] \\\\cdot \\\\cdot \\\\cdot [\\\\Gamma \\\\circ \\\\nu^+_{0,0}]$. Each $\\\\Gamma \\\\circ \\\\nu^+_{j,0}$ is part of some $\\\\alpha_k$, so we label $[\\\\Gamma \\\\circ \\\\nu^+_{j,0}]$ as $A$ or $B$ according to the label of $[\\\\alpha_k]$. Similarly, $\\\\omega'$ is related to the word $\\\\omega'' = [\\\\Gamma \\\\circ \\\\nu^+_{N-1,N}] \\\\cdot \\\\cdot \\\\cdot [\\\\Gamma \\\\circ \\\\nu^+_{0,N}]$. See Figure 12.1.\\n\\nThe idea of the proof is to match the topological side (the homotopy $\\\\Gamma$) to the algebraic side (words using elements $\\\\Pi_1(A)$ or $\\\\Pi_1(B)$ as letters). The labelling of the squares and the segments is the first step in doing so.\\n\\nInductive argument. We order the pairs $\\\\{(u, v)\\\\}_{0\\\\leq u,v \\\\leq N}$ increasingly using the lexicographic order. We are now going to find a sequence of words $\\\\omega_{u,v}$ and paths $\\\\gamma_{u,v} : [0, 1] \\\\to [0, 1]^2$, indexed by the $(u, v)$, such that:\\n\\n\u2022 $\\\\gamma_{u,v}$ is a concatenation of segments of the form $\\\\nu^\\\\pm_{a,b}$ and $\\\\chi^\\\\pm_{a,b}$.\\n\u2022 $\\\\gamma_{u,v}$ begins at $(0, 0)$ and finishes at $(1, 0)$.\\n\u2022 Concatenation of segments in $\\\\gamma_{u,v}$ corresponds to concatenation of letters in $\\\\omega_{u,v}$.\\n\u2022 Each letter of $\\\\omega_{u,v}$ is obtained from a segment of $\\\\gamma_{u,v}$ as follows: Each appearance of $\\\\nu^\\\\pm_{a,b}$ in $\\\\gamma_{u,v}$ corresponds to an appearance of the letter $[\\\\Gamma \\\\circ \\\\nu^\\\\pm_{u,v}]!$ in $\\\\omega_{u,v}$. The value of the label $!$ will be determined by the induction argument to be explained next. Things go analogously for each appearance of $\\\\chi^\\\\pm_{a,b}$ and $\\\\chi^\\\\pm_{a,b}$.\\n\\nIn particular, $\\\\Psi(\\\\omega_{u,v}) = [\\\\Gamma \\\\circ \\\\gamma_{u,v}]$. See Figure 12.2.\\n\\nIn the inductive step $(u, v)$ we will be considering moves (in the algebraic side) and homotopies of paths (in the topological side) given by the square $C_{u,v}$. The one exception is the base case $(u, v) = (-1, 0)$, where we simply set $\\\\omega_{-1,0} = \\\\omega_0$ and $\\\\gamma_{-1,0} = (\\\\Gamma \\\\circ \\\\nu^+_{N-1,0}) \\\\bullet \\\\cdot \\\\cdot \\\\cdot \\\\bullet (\\\\Gamma \\\\circ \\\\nu^+_{0,0})$.\\n\\nConsider the inductive step $(u, v)$ and write $(u', v')$ for the pair immediately before it. Let us suppose without loss of generality that $C_{u,v}$ is labeled as $A$. We focus on the square $C_{u,v}$ and we look at the segments of $\\\\gamma_{u',v'}$ that are sides of $C_{u,v}$. It will follow from the upcoming argument that these sides appear consecutively in $\\\\gamma_{u',v'}$, forming a curve $S$; see Figure 12.3. The segments of $S$ correspond to letters in $\\\\omega_{u',v'}$. Since they appear consecutively, they form a subword $\\\\eta \\\\subset \\\\omega_{u',v'}$. Each letter $q$ in $\\\\eta$ has a label, which may not be $A$. If that is the case, it means that the corresponding segment maps to $B$ (as the label says) but also to $A$ (because $C_{u,v}$ is fully contained in $A$). Since it maps to both, $q$ is the image $\\\\iota_B(p)$ of a class $p \\\\in \\\\Pi_1(A \\\\cap B)$. We can then use move (III) to replace each such $q$ by $\\\\iota_A(p)$; see Figure 12.3. In this manner we obtain a word $\\\\eta'$, with letters coming only from $\\\\Pi_1(A)$, that is equivalent to $\\\\eta$. Since all the letters are in the same groupoid, we can compose them thanks to move (II), yielding another equivalent word $\\\\eta''$, that has a single letter. By construction, $\\\\eta'' = [\\\\Gamma|_S]_A$.\\n\\nThe sides of $C_{u,v}$ not appearing in $\\\\gamma_{u',v'}$ form a curve $S'$ with the same endpoints as $S$. Observe that $S$ and $S'$ are homotopic to one another as curves in $[0, 1]^2$, relative endpoints. The homotopy is given by interpolating linearly within $C_{u,v}$. This implies that the letter $\\\\eta'' \\\\in \\\\Pi_1(A)$ is exactly the same as $[\\\\Gamma|_{S'}]_A$ (this is not a move, this is simply the definition of what a homotopy class relative endpoints is!). If $S'$ consists of multiple segments, we can apply move (II) to $\\\\eta''$ and produce a new word $\\\\eta'''$ whose letters correspond to said segments.\\n\\nWe conclude the induction by setting $\\\\omega_{u,v}$ to be the word we obtain from $\\\\omega_{u',v'}$ by replacing $\\\\eta$ by $\\\\eta'''$. By construction, the two are related by moves. Analogously, we define $\\\\gamma_{u,v}$ to be curve one obtains from $\\\\gamma_{u',v'}$ by replacing the segment $S$ for the segment $S'$. The two are homotopic relative endpoints.\\n\\nEnd of the proof of the injectivity Proposition 12.2. At the end of the argument we have produced a word $\\\\omega_{N,N}$ that is related by moves to $\\\\omega_{-1,0} = \\\\omega_0$ and thus to $\\\\omega$. It remains to observe that $\\\\omega_{N,N}$ is related to $\\\\omega''$ and thus to $\\\\omega'$. From the argument we see that\\n$\\\\omega_{N,N} = [\\\\Gamma \\\\circ \\\\chi^-_{N,0}][\\\\Gamma \\\\circ \\\\nu^+_{N-1,N}] \\\\cdot \\\\cdot \\\\cdot [\\\\Gamma \\\\circ \\\\chi^+_{0,N}][\\\\Gamma \\\\circ \\\\chi^-_{0,0}]$\\nbut all the paths $\\\\Gamma \\\\circ \\\\chi^\\\\pm_{a,b}$ appearing in the formula are constant, since $\\\\Gamma$ was a homotopy relative endpoints and $a$ equals $0$ or $N$. This means that all these classes are the identity by move (I). We therefore have\\n\\n$\\\\omega_{N,N} = [\\\\Gamma \\\\circ \\\\nu^+_{N-1,N}] \\\\cdot \\\\cdot \\\\cdot [\\\\Gamma \\\\circ \\\\nu^+_{0,N}]$\\n\\nwhich looks the same as $\\\\omega''$, but we have to be careful with labels. Indeed, the letters of $\\\\omega_{N,N}$ are labeled in some arbitrary way that may not match the labels in $\\\\omega''$. Nonetheless, we can reason as above and observe that if the labels do not match it is because the letter is in the image of $\\\\Pi_1(A \\\\cap B)$. We can thus apply move (III) and deduce that $\\\\omega''$ and $\\\\omega_{N,N}$ are related to each other. This concludes the proof.",

        "proof": "We consider first the only if direction. Consider a point $p$ lying in the interior of an edge $a$, whose label appears $n$ times. If $n = 1$, $p$ resembles a boundary point in a surface (Lemma 13.5), so it cannot have a euclidean neighbourhood. If $n = 2$, great. If $n > 2$, we reason as follows.\\n\\nEvery sufficiently small neighbourhood $U$ of $p$ satisfies that $U \\\\setminus \\\\{p\\\\}$ retracts to a graph $X$ with fundamental group $*_{n-1}\\\\mathbb{Z}$; see Figure 13.1. Suppose that $p$ also has a neighbourhood $V$ homeomorphic to $\\\\mathbb{R}^2$. Then $V \\\\setminus \\\\{p\\\\}$ deformation retracts to $S^1$. Putting these facts together we obtain a retraction $r : V \\\\setminus \\\\{p\\\\} \\\\to X$, whose pushforward\\n\\n$r_* : \\\\pi_1(V \\\\setminus \\\\{p\\\\}, q) \\\\to (X, q)$\\n\\nmust be surjective. However, the former group is isomorphic to $\\\\mathbb{Z}$ and the latter to $*_{n-1}\\\\mathbb{Z}$. This is not possible, since we can apply the abelianisation and tensor with $\\\\mathbb{R}$ functors to $r_*$ and obtain a surjective linear map $\\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$, yielding a contradiction. Working it all out in detail is Exercise 13.2.\\n\\nFor the if direction, the proof amounts to exhibiting a euclidean neighbourhood for each point $p \\\\in P$. Within the face $F$ this is immediate. If $p$ is in the interior of an edge $a$, this follows by glueing two half-discs incident to $a$. The remaining case is for $p$ to be a vertex. By construction, $p$ is an equivalence class of vertices of $F$. Namely, the equivalence class given by identifying different sides according to their labels. Given the collection $\\\\{q_1, \\\\cdot \\\\cdot \\\\cdot, q_l\\\\}$ of vertices in $F$ corresponding to $p$, we can consider the corners in $P$ incident to each $q_i$ and glue them along the sides according to the labels. Since each label appears twice, this will assemble a small disc neighbourhood of $p$. See Figure 13.2.",

Moreover, its fundamental group is computed by taking a maximal tree $T \\\\subset P_1$, which in this case is the edge $a$, and then observing that every further attachment of an edge yields a new generator. $b$ is attached to $p$, forming a loop, so is represents a generator. $c$ is attached to $q$, so it is a loop, but not based at $p$. The corresponding loop based at $p$ is instead $c' := aca^{-1}$, which is obtained from $c$ by performing change of basepoint using the edge $a$.\\n\\n$P$ is obtained from $P_1$ by attaching the face $F$. Its attaching gives us a single relation, which is the word $\\\\omega$. Now we have to be careful: as written, $\\\\omega$ is not a word on the symbols $b$ and $c'$.

The class $b$ lives in the group $\\\\pi_1(P, p)$, the class $c$ lives in $\\\\pi_1(P, q)$, and $a$ lives in $\\\\pi_1(P, q, p)$. The class $c'$ is in $\\\\pi_1(P, p)$ as well, and is a conjugate of $c$ via $a$. It follows that we are allowed to rewrite $\\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Pi_1(P)$ using moves, and it is best to express it in terms of generators of $\\\\pi_1(P, p)$. This is what we just did.

        "proof": "The desired conclusion forces us to define the $n$-th skeleton $Y_n$ as the preimage of $X_n$. We will now explain how $Y_n$ is obtained from $Y_{n-1}$ by attaching $n$-cells, but we will not be able to complete the argument rigorously, since it needs the results of Section 17.1.\\n\\nThe general idea is that, given a cell $\\\\psi : D^n \\\\to X$ passing through $x \\\\in X_{n-1}$ and a point $y \\\\in \\\\pi^{-1}(x)$, there is a unique cell $\\\\tilde{\\\\psi} : D^n \\\\to Y$ passing through $y$ and satisfying $\\\\pi \\\\circ \\\\tilde{\\\\psi} = \\\\psi$. This means that $\\\\tilde{\\\\psi}$ is a lift of $\\\\psi$. This concept is introduced in Definition 16.17 below and most of covering space theory boils down to understanding it well.\\n\\nHere is thus the proof. The existence of a unique lift $\\\\tilde{\\\\psi}$ passing through $y$ is a consequence of the lifting criterion (Theorem 17.1), using the fact that $D^n$ is simply-connected. Since the restriction of $\\\\psi$ to the boundary is the attaching map, which takes values in $X_{n-1}$, it follows that $\\\\tilde{\\\\psi}$ restricted to the boundary takes values in $Y_{n-1}$. With this, we have exhibited $Y_n$ as a union of cells.\\n\\nIt remains to show that $Y$ indeed has the quotient topology inherited from the disjoint union of all cells, up to the identifications given by the attaching. This we can check locally: given a point $y \\\\in Y$, we pick a small open $U$ intersecting only cells incident to $y$. We can moreover assume that $U$ is one of the sheets over the evenly covered $\\\\pi(U)$. Since $\\\\pi(U)$ is obtained from the (parts of) cells it intersects by quotienting, the same is true for $U$.",

Concretely: According to the Lebesgue covering lemma, the domain of $\\\\gamma$ can be divided into intervals $I_i$ so that $\\\\gamma|_{I_i}$ takes values in an evenly-covered open $U_i$. We can thus consider $U_0 \\\\ni \\\\gamma(0)$ and the sheet $U'_0$ over it containing $\\\\tilde{\\\\gamma}(0)$. We then use the homeomorphism $\\\\phi$ between $U_0$ and $U'_0$ to define $\\\\tilde{\\\\gamma}|_{I_0} = \\\\phi \\\\circ \\\\gamma|_{I_0}$. Observe that this is the unique way to define a continuous lift, since all other preimages of $\\\\gamma|_{I_0}$ live in other sheets, which are disconnected from $\\\\tilde{\\\\gamma}(0)$. One then continues by induction on $i$.\\n\\nFor the general case, where we have a homotopy $F$ and a lift $\\\\tilde{f}$ of $f = F(-, 0)$, one argues similarly.

Under this identification, $\\\\mathbb{Z}$ is identified with $\\\\pi_1(S^1, 1)$, since both are the fibres over $0$ via the covering map. This tells us already that $\\\\pi_1(S^1, 1)$ is countable infinite. However, this is just set theoretically.

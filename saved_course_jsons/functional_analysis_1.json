We now claim that $C(K)$ is separable also when equipped with the $L^p$ norm instead of the usual sup-norm. Indeed as $\\\\|f\\\\|_{L^p} \\\\leq (\\\\int_K \\\\|f\\\\|^p)^{1/p} \\\\leq L^n(K)^{1/p}\\\\|f\\\\|_{\\\\sup}$ we know that if a sequence $f_n$ converges to some element $f \\\\in C(K)$ in the usual sense of the sup-norm, then also $\\\\|f_n - f\\\\|_{L^p} \\\\leq L^n(K)^{1/p}\\\\|f_n - f\\\\|_{\\\\sup} \\\\to 0$.

        "proof": "The proof will be split into two parts. In Part 1, we show that $L$ is well-defined and isometric. In Part 2, we prove that $L$ is surjective.\\n\\nPart 1: We show that $L$ is well-defined and isometric.\\n\\nWe note that since $p, q$ are so that $\\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{1}{q} = 1$ we know from H\u00f6lder's inequality that the product $fg$ of two functions $f \\\\in L^q(\\\\Omega)$ and $g \\\\in L^p(\\\\Omega)$ is integrable and\\n$$\\\\left|\\\\int_{\\\\Omega} fg\\\\,dx\\\\right| \\\\leq \\\\|f\\\\|_{L^q} \\\\|g\\\\|_{L^p}.$$\\n\\nWe now remark that since the integral is linear, we have that for all $f, \\\\tilde{f} \\\\in L^q(\\\\Omega)$, $\\\\lambda \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$ and any $g \\\\in L^p(\\\\Omega)$ that $L(f + \\\\lambda \\\\tilde{f})(g) = Lf(g) + \\\\lambda L\\\\tilde{f}(g)$, i.e., that the map $L: f \\\\mapsto L_f$ is linear. Similarly, given any $f \\\\in L^q(\\\\Omega)$ we have that for any $g, \\\\tilde{g} \\\\in L^p(\\\\Omega)$ and any $\\\\lambda \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$ that $L_f(g + \\\\lambda\\\\tilde{g}) = L_f(g) + \\\\lambda L_f(\\\\tilde{g})$ so $L_f$ is a linear map from $L^p$ to $\\\\mathbb{R}$ and indeed an element of $(L^p(\\\\Omega))^*$ as it is bounded with\\n$$\\\\|L_f\\\\|_{(L^p(\\\\Omega))^*} = \\\\sup_{g\\\\in L^q,g\\\\neq 0} \\\\frac{|L_f(g)|}{\\\\|g\\\\|_{L^p}} = \\\\sup_{g\\\\in L^q,g\\\\neq 0} \\\\frac{|\\\\int fg|}{\\\\|g\\\\|_{L^p}} \\\\leq \\\\sup_{g\\\\in L^q,g\\\\neq 0} \\\\frac{\\\\|f\\\\|_{L^q} \\\\|g\\\\|_{L^p}}{\\\\|g\\\\|_{L^p}} = \\\\|f\\\\|_{L^q}$$\\nwhere we used H\u00f6lder's inequality in the penultimate step.\\n\\nWe finally show that also\\n$$\\\\|L_f\\\\|_{L^p(\\\\Omega)^*} \\\\geq \\\\|f\\\\|_{L^q}$$\\nfor every $f \\\\in L^q$ and thus that $L$ is indeed isometric.\\n\\nThis proof is a bit technical as we need to be careful with the exponents. We first treat the case that $p > 1$ and hence $q < \\\\infty$.\\n\\nThe estimate is trivial if $f = 0$ so suppose that $f \\\\neq 0$. We choose $g := |f|^{q-2}f$ so that $fg = |f|^q$ and hence $L(f)(g) = \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} |f|^q dx = \\\\|f\\\\|^q_{L^q}$. We now note that since $\\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{1}{q} = 1$ we have $(q-1)p = q$ and so\\n$$\\\\|g\\\\|_{L^p} = \\\\left(\\\\int |g|^p dx\\\\right)^{1/p} = \\\\left(\\\\int (|f|^{(q-1)})^p dx\\\\right)^{1/p} = \\\\left(\\\\int |f|^q dx\\\\right)^{1/q \\\\cdot (q-1)} = \\\\|f\\\\|^{q-1}_{L^q}$$\\nwhich means that\\n$$\\\\frac{L_f(g)}{\\\\|g\\\\|_{L^p}} = \\\\frac{\\\\|f\\\\|^q_{L^q}}{\\\\|f\\\\|^{q-1}_{L^q}} = \\\\|f\\\\|_{L^q}$$\\nand hence that $\\\\|L_f\\\\|_{(L^p)^*} \\\\geq \\\\|f\\\\|_{L^q}$ as claimed.\\n\\nIf $p = 1$ and hence $q = \\\\infty$ then we prove that for any $\\\\varepsilon > 0$ there exists a function $g_\\\\varepsilon \\\\in L^1$ so that $\\\\frac{L_f(g)}{\\\\|g\\\\|_{L^1}} \\\\geq \\\\|f\\\\|_{L^\\\\infty} - \\\\varepsilon$. To this end we consider the set $A_\\\\varepsilon := \\\\{x : |f(x)| \\\\geq \\\\|f\\\\|_{L^\\\\infty} - \\\\varepsilon\\\\}$, which is measurable (and well defined up to a null set). If this set has finite measure then we define $g_\\\\varepsilon(x) := \\\\text{sign}(f(x)) \\\\cdot \\\\chi_{A_\\\\varepsilon}$ which is in $L^1(\\\\Omega)$ with $L^1$-norm equal to the measure of $A_\\\\varepsilon$, which by the definition of the $L^\\\\infty$ norm is positive. As $fg \\\\geq (\\\\|f\\\\|_{L^\\\\infty} - \\\\varepsilon)\\\\chi_{A_\\\\varepsilon}$ we can thus immediately check that $L_f(g) \\\\geq (\\\\|f\\\\|_{L^\\\\infty} - \\\\varepsilon)\\\\|g_\\\\varepsilon\\\\|_{L^1}$ which gives the claimed bound. Finally, if $A_\\\\varepsilon$ has infinite measure, then we can replace $A_\\\\varepsilon$ by any subset $\\\\tilde{A}_\\\\varepsilon \\\\subset A_\\\\varepsilon$ whose measure is finite and positive and apply the above argument for the corresponding function $g_\\\\varepsilon \\\\in L^1$.\\n\\nPart 2: We show that $L$ is surjective when $\\\\Omega$ is bounded.\\n\\nLet $\\\\ell \\\\in (L^p(\\\\Omega))^*$ and we would like to find $f \\\\in L^q(\\\\Omega)$ such that $\\\\ell(g) = \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} fg\\\\,dx$ for all $g \\\\in L^p(\\\\Omega)$.\\n\\nObserve that the set function $\\\\psi(E) = \\\\ell(\\\\chi_E)$ is $\\\\sigma$-additive (that is, a signed measure) and absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. (Note that $\\\\psi$ is well-defined as $\\\\chi_E \\\\in L^p(\\\\Omega)$, thanks to the boundedness of $\\\\Omega$.) By the Radon-Nikodym theorem (Theorem 7.3.3), there exists a function $f \\\\in L^1(\\\\Omega)$ such that\\n$$\\\\psi(E) = \\\\int_E f\\\\,dx \\\\text{ for all measurable } E \\\\subset \\\\Omega.$$\\n\\nThis implies that\\n$$\\\\ell(\\\\chi_E) = \\\\int_E f\\\\,dx \\\\text{ for all measurable } E \\\\subset \\\\Omega,$$\\nand so by linearity\\n$$\\\\ell(s) = \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} fs\\\\,dx \\\\text{ for all simple functions } s.$$\\n\\nConsider $h \\\\in L^p(\\\\Omega) \\\\cap L^\\\\infty(\\\\Omega)$. Recall from Part A integration that there exists a sequence $(h_j)$ of simple functions such that $|h_j| \\\\leq |h|$ and $h_j \\\\to h$ a.e. It then follows by Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem that\\n$$\\\\ell(h) = \\\\lim_{j\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\ell(h_j) = \\\\lim_{j\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} fh_j\\\\,dx = \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} \\\\lim_{j\\\\to\\\\infty} fh_j\\\\,dx = \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} fh\\\\,dx.$$\\n\\nConsider next $g \\\\in L^p(\\\\Omega)$. We approximate $g$ by truncation:\\n$$g_k(x) = \\\\begin{cases} g(x) & \\\\text{if } |g(x)| \\\\leq k, \\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{otherwise}, \\\\end{cases}$$\\nso that $g_k \\\\to g$ in $L^p(\\\\Omega)$, in view of Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem. Then\\n$$\\\\ell(g) = \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\ell(g_k) = \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} fg_k\\\\,dx,$$\\nbut at this point we have difficulty to interchange the limit and the integration. We circumvent the issue as follows: Consider the function $\\\\tilde{g}_k = |g_k|\\\\text{sign}(f)$. We have\\n$$\\\\|\\\\ell\\\\|_{(L^p)^*}\\\\|g\\\\|_{L^p} \\\\geq \\\\|\\\\ell\\\\|_{(L^p)^*}\\\\|\\\\tilde{g}_k\\\\|_{L^p} \\\\geq |\\\\ell(\\\\tilde{g}_k)| = \\\\left|\\\\int_{\\\\Omega} f\\\\tilde{g}_k\\\\,dx\\\\right| = \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} |f||g_k|\\\\,dx.$$\\n\\nSending $k \\\\to \\\\infty$ and using Lebesgue's monotone convergence theorem, we have $\\\\|\\\\ell\\\\|_{(L^p)^*}\\\\|g\\\\|_{L^p} \\\\geq \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} |f||g|\\\\,dx$, that is $fg$ is integrable. We can now continue the previous chain of identity with Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem to obtain\\n$$\\\\ell(g) = \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} fg_k\\\\,dx = \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} fg_k\\\\,dx = \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} fg\\\\,dx.$$\\n\\nBy the converse of H\u00f6lder's inequality, this also implies that $f \\\\in L^q(\\\\Omega)$:\\n$$\\\\|f\\\\|_{L^q} = \\\\sup_{g\\\\in L^p(\\\\Omega),\\\\|g\\\\|_{L^p}=1} \\\\left|\\\\int_{\\\\Omega} fg\\\\,dx\\\\right| = \\\\sup_{g\\\\in L^p(\\\\Omega),\\\\|g\\\\|_{L^p}=1} |\\\\ell(g)| = \\\\|\\\\ell\\\\|_{(L^p)^*}.$$\\n\\nThis concludes the proof.",

As $V$ is a closed subspace of a Banach space it is also Banach and we can consider the map $S := (I - T)|_V : V \\\\to X$ whose image is $S(V) = (I - T)(V) = (I - T)(X)$ as $(I - T)(Y) = \\\\{0\\\\}$. It hence suffices to show that $S(V)$ is closed and this follows from Lemma 1.18 provided we show that $S$ satisfies (1.9), which we will do by contradiction.\\n\\nSo suppose that there is no $\\\\delta > 0$ so that $\\\\|Sv\\\\| \\\\geq \\\\delta\\\\|v\\\\|$ for all $v \\\\in V$. Then we can choose $v_n \\\\in V$ so that $\\\\|Sv_n\\\\| < \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\|v_n\\\\|$ and replacing $v_n$ by $\\\\frac{v_n}{\\\\|v_n\\\\|}$ we can assume that $\\\\|v_n\\\\| = 1$ and hence $\\\\|Tv_n - v_n\\\\| = \\\\|Sv_n\\\\| \\\\to 0$. As $T$ is compact we can pass to a subsequence so that $Tv_{n_j}$ converges, say $Tv_{n_j} \\\\to z$. As $T(v_{n_j}) - v_{n_j} \\\\to 0$ this also implies that $v_{n_j} \\\\to z$. As $V$ is closed we must hence have $z \\\\in V$ and as $\\\\|v_{n_j}\\\\| = 1$ we must have $\\\\|z\\\\| = 1$ so $z \\\\neq 0$. However as $T$ is continuous and hence $z = \\\\lim T v_{n_j} = T(\\\\lim v_{n_j}) = Tz$ we also have $z \\\\in Y$ so $z \\\\in Y \\\\cap V = \\\\{0\\\\}$ which gives a contradiction.\\n\\nThe final claim of the proposition immediately follows since $T$ is assumed to be selfadjoint and since the image of $I - T$ is closed and hence, by (1.5), $(\\\\ker(I - T))^\\\\perp = (I - T^*)(X) = (I - T)(X) = (I - T)(X)$.",

The adjoint $S^*$ of $S$ is an operator from $Z$ to $X$.

To make the notation clearer, we rename it as $V \\\\in B(Z, W)$, $Vz = S^*z$ for all $z \\\\in Z$.

        "proof": "We will only prove the theorem in the case of Hilbert spaces, which are reflexive thanks to the Riesz representation theorem.\\n\\nSo let $(x_n)$ be a sequence in the unit ball of a Hilbert space $X$. We first show:\\n\\nClaim 1: There exists a subsequence $(x_{n_j})$ of $(x_n)$, such that $\\\\langle x_{n_j}, x_m \\\\rangle$ converges for every $m$.\\n\\nProof of Claim 1:\\nWe use a diagonal sequence argument: As $(x_n)$ is bounded we know from Cauchy-Schwarz that the sequence $\\\\langle x_n, x_1 \\\\rangle$ is a bounded sequence in $F$. By Bolzano-Weierstrass, we can hence extract a subsequence $n^{(1)}_j$ such that $\\\\langle x_{n^{(1)}_j}, x_1 \\\\rangle$ is convergent.\\n\\nWe then consider $\\\\langle x_{n^{(1)}_j}, x_2 \\\\rangle$, which is again a bounded sequence in $F$ and select a convergent subsequence $\\\\langle x_{n^{(2)}_j}, x_2 \\\\rangle$. Clearly, $\\\\langle x_{n^{(2)}_j}, x_1 \\\\rangle$ is also convergent.\\n\\nProceeding in this way, we construct nested subsequence $(n^{(k)}_j)$ such that $\\\\langle x_{n^{(k)}_j}, x_m \\\\rangle$ is convergent (with respect to $j$) for every $m \\\\leq k$.\\n\\nFinally we set $x_{n_j} = x_{n^{(j)}_j}$ and use that for every fixed $m$, $(n_j)_{j \\\\geq m}$ is a subsequence of $(n^{(m)}_j)_{j \\\\geq m}$. It follows that $\\\\langle x_{n_j}, x_m \\\\rangle$ is convergent for every $m$.\\n\\nFor this subsequence, we then show\\n\\nClaim 2: $\\\\langle x_{n_j}, x \\\\rangle$ converges for every $x \\\\in X$.\\n\\nProof of Claim 2:\\nBy linearity and claim 1 it is clear that for every $y \\\\in Y := \\\\text{span}\\\\{x_1, x_2, ...\\\\}$ as elements of this space are finite linear combinations of elements $x_m$.\\n\\nNext we claim that if $y$ is in the the closed linear span $\\\\overline{Y}$ of $\\\\{x_1, ...\\\\}$ then $\\\\langle x_{n_j}, y \\\\rangle$ is a Cauchy sequence so also converges.\\n\\nTo see this it suffices to consider $\\\\varepsilon > 0$ with, use that $Y$ is dense in $\\\\overline{Y}$ and that we can hence choose $\\\\tilde{y} \\\\in Y$ with $\\\\|y - \\\\tilde{y}\\\\| \\\\leq \\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\varepsilon$. As we know that $\\\\langle x_{n_j}, \\\\tilde{y} \\\\rangle$ is convergent, and hence Cauchy, we can then choose $N$ so that $|\\\\langle x_{n_j} - x_{n_k}, \\\\tilde{y} \\\\rangle| < \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\varepsilon$ for all $j, k \\\\geq N$.\\n\\nApplying first the triangle inequality and then Cauchy-Schwarz thus gives\\n\\n$|\\\\langle x_{n_j} - x_{n'_j}, y \\\\rangle| \\\\leq |\\\\langle x_{n_j} - x_{n'_j}, \\\\tilde{y} \\\\rangle| + |\\\\langle x_{n_j} - x_{n'_j}, \\\\tilde{y} - y \\\\rangle| \\\\leq \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\varepsilon + 2\\\\|y - \\\\tilde{y}\\\\| \\\\leq \\\\varepsilon$.\\n\\nOn the other hand, it is clear that $\\\\langle x_{n_j}, z \\\\rangle = 0$ for all $z \\\\in Y^{\\\\perp}$. Hence, as $X = \\\\overline{Y} \\\\oplus Y^{\\\\perp}$ by the projection theorem, we have that $\\\\langle x_{n_j}, x \\\\rangle$ is convergent for all $x \\\\in X$.\\n\\nWe can now finally show\\n\\nClaim 3: $x_{n_j}$ converges weakly to some $x^*$.\\n\\nProof of Claim 3: As $\\\\langle x_{n_j}, x \\\\rangle$ is convergent for all $x \\\\in X$ we can define the linear map\\n\\n$\\\\ell(x) = \\\\lim_{j \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\langle x, x_{n_j} \\\\rangle, \\\\quad x \\\\in X$\\n\\nwhich is an element of $X^*$ with $\\\\|\\\\ell\\\\| \\\\leq 1$ since Cauchy-Schwarz ensures that $\\\\|\\\\ell(x)\\\\| \\\\leq \\\\sup \\\\|x_{n_j}\\\\|\\\\|x\\\\| \\\\leq \\\\|x\\\\|$ for every $x$. By the Riesz representation theorem, there is hence some $x^* \\\\in X$ with $\\\\|x^*\\\\| \\\\leq 1$ such that $\\\\ell(x) = \\\\langle x, x^* \\\\rangle$ for all $x \\\\in X$. This implies that $\\\\langle x_{n_j} - x^*, x \\\\rangle = \\\\langle x, x_{n_j} - x^* \\\\rangle \\\\to 0$ for every $x$ and hence that $T(x_{n_j} - x^*) \\\\to 0$ for every $T \\\\in X^*$ as the Riesz representation theorem allows us to write any such $T$ as map $z \\\\mapsto \\\\langle z, x \\\\rangle$ for some $x$.

Additionally we note that $(T - \\\\lambda_k I)(X_k) \\\\subset X_{k-1}$ as $E_{\\\\lambda_k}$ is the kernel of this map.\\n\\nSimilar to above we can now use the Riesz-lemma to get a sequence of unit vectors $x_k \\\\in X_k$ with $\\\\text{dist}(x_k, X_{k-1}) \\\\geq \\\\frac{1}{2}$.\\n\\nIf $n < m$ then $X_{m-1}$ contains both $X_n$, and thus $T x_n \\\\in T(X_n) \\\\subset X_n$, and also $(T - \\\\lambda_m I)(X_m)$, and thus $T x_m - \\\\lambda x_m$, so we get that\\n\\n$\\\\|T x_m - T x_n\\\\| = \\\\|\\\\lambda_m x_m + (T - \\\\lambda_m)x_m - T x_n\\\\| \\\\geq \\\\text{dist}(\\\\lambda_m x_m, X_{m-1}) \\\\geq \\\\frac{1}{2} |\\\\lambda_m| \\\\geq \\\\frac{1}{2} r > 0$\\n\\nThe sequence $(T x_n)$ hence cannot have any subsequence which is Cauchy, which leads to a contradiction as $(x_n)$ is bounded and $T$ is compact.\\n\\nWe note that if $X$ is Hilbert and $T$ is selfadjoint then this argument can be simplified significantly: We first pass to a subsequence to ensure that the $\\\\lambda_j$ converge, then choose for each $\\\\lambda_j$ a unit eigenvector $e_j$ and use that as $T$ is selfadjoint these $e_j$ are orthonormal and hence so that $\\\\|e_j - e_k\\\\| = \\\\sqrt{2}$.\\n\\nAt the same time, as $T$ is compact there is a subsequence so that $T e_{j_n} = \\\\lambda_j e_{j_n}$ converges and combined with the convergence of the $\\\\lambda_j \\\\to \\\\lambda \\\\neq 0$ this gives convergence of $e_{j_n}$, contradiction.\\n\\nIt hence remains to show (iii) and for this we inductively construct the $e_k$ using that Corollary 5.11 (which was a consequence of Gelfand's formula) ensures that the spectral radius of any selfadjoint operator is equal to the norm of the operator.\\n\\nWe first set $S_1 = T$ and consider this as an operator on $X_1 = X$, apply Corollary 5.11 to find $\\\\lambda_1 \\\\in \\\\sigma(S_1)$ so that $|\\\\lambda_1| = \\\\|S_1\\\\|$ and let $e_1, \\\\ldots, e_{k_1}$ be an on-basis of the (finite dimensional as $S_1$ compact!) space $Z_1 := \\\\ker(S_1 - \\\\lambda_1 I_{X_1})$.
